A list of shorthands used for more efficient logging and nice Ctrl-f


| Code      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| RES      |  server response / input       |
| REQ      |  server request / output       |
| SOC      | succefully open connection        |
| SCC      | successfully close connection to another server   |

suggestion: if possible, turn on syntax highlighting for Lua, makes the the logs relatively readable
